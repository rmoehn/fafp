# Solutions to Exercises in Advanced Functional Programming

In 2013 Cezar Ionescu held the [course Advanced Functional
Programming](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/members/ionescu/advanced-functional-programming)
at my university. These are solutions to some of the exercises.

Originally, I added some of the lecture notes and other things from the
lecturer to this repository. I think I filtered out everything, but notice me
if you find any remains.
